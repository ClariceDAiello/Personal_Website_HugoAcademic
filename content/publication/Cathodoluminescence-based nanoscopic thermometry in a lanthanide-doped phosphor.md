abstract = "Crucial to analyze phenomena as varied as plasmonic hot spots and the spread of cancer in living tissue, nanoscale thermometry is challenging: probes are usually larger than the sample under study, and contact techniques may alter the sample temperature itself. Many photostable nanomaterials whose luminescence is temperature-dependent, such as lanthanide-doped phosphors, have been shown to be good non-contact thermometric sensors when optically excited. Using such nanomaterials, in this work we accomplished the key milestone of enabling far-field thermometry with a spatial resolution that is not diffraction-limited at readout. </br> </br> We explore thermal effects on the cathodoluminescence of lanthanide-doped NaYF$\\_4$ nanoparticles. Whereas cathodoluminescence from such lanthanide-doped nanomaterials has been previously observed, here we characterize such emission quantitatively, and for the first time with applications beyond localization. We demonstrate a thermometry scheme that is based on cathodoluminescence lifetime changes as a function of temperature that achieves $\\sim$ 30 mK sensitivity in sub-$\\mu$m nanoparticle patches. The scheme is robust against spurious effects related to electron beam radiation damage and optical alignment fluctuations. </br> </br>  We foresee the potential of single nanoparticles, of sheets of nanoparticles, and also of thin films of lanthanide-doped NaYF$\\_4$ to yield temperature information via cathodoluminescence changes when in the vicinity of a sample of interest; the phosphor may even protect the sample from direct contact to damaging electron beam radiation. Cathodoluminescence-based thermometry is thus a valuable novel tool towards temperature monitoring at the nanoscale, with broad applications including heat dissipation in miniaturized electronics and biological diagnostics. </br>"
