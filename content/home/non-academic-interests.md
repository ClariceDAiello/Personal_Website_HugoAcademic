I firmly believe that scientists (and everybody else!) should be well-rounded individuals.

I have always been a bookworm and thrived in learning languages. I find it befitting that the German word for "vocabulary" is "Wortschatz" -- which literally translates to "word treasure". I enjoy writing and wordsmithing.

I have also dabbled in piano and chorale singing; and taken a liking to long-distance running, yoga-ing and meditating.

Finally, I have a serious interest in wine (Wine and Spirit Education Trust Level 3 Award, Boston University's Certificate in Wine Studies, French Wine Scholar). Cheers!
